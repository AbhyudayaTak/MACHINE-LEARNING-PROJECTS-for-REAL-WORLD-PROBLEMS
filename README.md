   - Predicts the price of cars based on various features.
   - Files: `car_data.csv`, `carPrice_pred.ipynb`

2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
   - Detects fraudulent transactions using classification algorithms.
   - Files: `creditcard.csv`, `fraud_detection.ipynb`

3. **Diabetes Prediction**
   - Predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients.
   - Files: `diabetes.csv`, `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`, `trained_model.sav`

4. **Gold Price Prediction**
   - Forecasts gold prices using historical data.
